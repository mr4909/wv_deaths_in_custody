It was obtained by the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy through a FOIA request filed by policy analyst Sara Whitaker.\n\nEach row represents a death, with key fields including:\n\n- `date_of_death` and `booking_date`\n- `age`, `race`, `gender`\n- `facility` and `offender_status` (e.g., pretrial vs. sentenced)\n- `manner_of_death` and `cause_of_death`\n\nDCR’s annual reports do not publish this level of detail. Jail deaths are excluded, and no information is provided by facility, demographics, or cause. This dataset allows for deeper analysis of where, when, and how people are dying in custody.\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nIn this section, we’ll begin exploring:\n\n- How many deaths occurred each year?\n- Which facilities have the highest number of deaths? \n- How do deaths vary by custody status (pretrial vs. sentenced)?\n- Are certain groups disproportionately affected?\n- Are facilities with high mortality rates experiencing overcrowding?\n\nWe’ll also examine patterns in cause of death and compare counts to what DCR reports in its official publications.\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
