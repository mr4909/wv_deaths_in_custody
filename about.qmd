## Purpose

In West Virginia, people continue to die in jails and prisons with little public scrutiny and almost no official transparency. The state does not publish the names of those who die in custody. It does not release the facilities where deaths occur, the demographic details of those who die, or what caused their deaths. Public records are inconsistent, and in many cases, incomplete—especially for deaths in regional jails.

Families are left without answers. The public is left without oversight. This project seeks to address that gap.

It provides the first publicly accessible, facility-level dataset of deaths in the custody of the **West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR)**. The goal is not only to document when and where people have died, but to place those deaths in context—by linking them to jail and prison conditions, population levels, and state records that are rarely disclosed or easily accessible.

## Why It Matters

DCR oversees 11 regional jails and 7 state prisons. They provide **monthly death counts from prisons** in their annual reports—but:

- It does **not report deaths in regional jails**
- It does **not include names, causes of death, or facility-level data**
- It excludes deaths that occur after hospital transfers or administrative releases
- There is **no centralized public database** for jail and prison mortality in the state

This makes public oversight nearly impossible.

## Data Source

In 2024, **Sara Whitaker**, a policy analyst at the **West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy (WVCBP)**, submitted a public records request (FOIA) asking DCR to release case-level information on all deaths in custody since 2020.

> The FOIA response included **six tables embedded in a PDF**, listing deaths by date, facility, demographic information, and manner of death.

I manually extracted and cleaned those tables into a usable dataset.

[Are Fewer People Dying in West Virginia Jails—or Is the State Simply Not Counting?](https://wvpolicy.org/are-fewer-people-dying-in-west-virginia-jails-or-is-the-state-simply-not-counting)

## This Project Builds on That Work

While Whitaker's work highlighted the transparency failures around deaths in custody, this site focuses on **independent data analysis and visualization** of the same source.

This includes:

- Cleaning and merging all six FOIA tables  
- Standardizing facility names and linking them to facility type (jail vs. prison)  
- Creating reproducible code and documentation  
- Publishing a structured, interactive website for public use  

## What’s Included

This site features:

- A downloadable, cleaned dataset of 284 deaths from 2020 to 2025  
- Interactive charts exploring **facility-level patterns**  
- Filters by **age, gender, race, cause of death, and custody status**  
- A research log to document data issues, assumptions, and updates  

## What's Next

Future updates will include:

- Jail capacity data to examine **overcrowding as a potential risk factor**  
- Cross-referencing with **UCLA’s Behind Bars** dataset for comparison  
- Adding **incident narratives and lawsuits** when available  
- Estimating **underreporting** or inconsistent categorization of deaths
