The data comes from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and includes details that are not available in DCR’s public reports:\n\nDate of death\n\nFacility name\n\nAge, race, and gender\n\nManner and cause of death\n\nWhether the person was awaiting trial or already sentenced"

The public, too, is left in the dark—unable to understand where and why these deaths happen, or what conditions may have contributed to them. In West Virginia, meaningful transparency around deaths in custody is rare. The state does not publish names, demographic details, causes of death, or the facilities where people died. Many deaths—particularly in jails—are not reflected in public reporting at all.\nThis project exists to help fill that gap.\nIt provides the first publicly accessible, facility-level dataset of deaths in West Virginia’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR) custody. It seeks to document when and where people have died, and to offer context around those deaths by linking them to facility characteristics and other public data."
