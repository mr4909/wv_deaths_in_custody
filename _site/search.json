    "text": "What’s really happening inside West Virginia’s jails and prisons?\nEach year, people die in the custody of West Virginia’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR)—but the public rarely learns who they were, where they died, or what happened to them.\nThis site exists to change that.\nIt presents the first facility-level dataset of reported deaths in DCR custody, covering both prisons and regional jails. The data comes from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and includes details that are not available in DCR’s public reports:\n\nDate of death\n\nFacility name\n\nAge, race, and gender\n\nManner and cause of death\n\nWhether the person was awaiting trial or already sentenced"

But:\n\nDeaths in jails are excluded entirely\nThere is no breakdown by facility, demographics, or cause\nNo names, narratives, or circumstances are ever shared\n\nThis means the public cannot see patterns, identify red flags, or hold the system accountable."

    "text": "Why this matters\nWest Virginia has had one of the highest jail death rates in the country over the past decade. But with no facility-level reporting, there is:\n\nNo transparency around which jails or prisons are most at risk\n\nNo public system to track systemic failures like overcrowding or neglect\n\nNo routine disclosure when people die in government custody\n\nWithout outside scrutiny, the system operates in silence—even as lawsuits and investigative reporting reveal troubling patterns."
