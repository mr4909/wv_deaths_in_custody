    "text": "About the Data\nThis dataset includes 289 deaths in West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR) custody from January 2020 through March 2025. It was obtained by the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy through a FOIA request filed by senior policy analyst Sara Whitaker.\nEach row represents a death, with key fields including:\n\ndate_of_death and booking_date\nage, race, gender\nfacility and offender_status (e.g., pretrial vs. sentenced)\nmanner_of_death and cause_of_death\n\nDCR’s annual reports do not publish this level of detail. Jail deaths are excluded, and no information is provided by facility, demographics, or cause. This dataset allows for deeper analysis of where, when, and how people are dying in custody."

    "text": "Purpose\nWhen someone dies in a jail or prison, their loved ones are often left without answers. The public, too, is left in the dark—unable to understand where and why these deaths happen, or what conditions may have contributed to them. In West Virginia, meaningful transparency around deaths in custody is rare. The state does not publish names, demographic details, causes of death, or the facilities where people died. Many deaths—particularly in jails—are not reflected in public reporting at all.\nThis project exists to help fill that gap.\nIt provides the first publicly accessible, facility-level dataset of deaths in West Virginia’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR) custody. It seeks to document when and where people have died, and to offer context around those deaths by linking them to facility characteristics and other public data."

    "text": "Why It Matters\nDCR oversees 11 regional jails and 7 state prisons. They provide monthly death counts from prisons in their annual reports—but:\n\nIt does not report deaths in regional jails\nIt does not include names, causes of death, or facility-level data\nIt excludes deaths that occur after hospital transfers or administrative releases\nThere is no centralized public database for jail and prison mortality in the state\n\nThis makes public oversight nearly impossible."
