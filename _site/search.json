It was obtained by the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy through a FOIA request filed by senior policy analyst Sara Whitaker.\nEach row represents a death, with key fields including:\n\ndate_of_death and booking_date\nage, race, gender\nfacility and offender_status (e.g., pretrial vs. sentenced)\nmanner_of_death and cause_of_death\n\nDCR’s annual reports do not publish this level of detail. Jail deaths are excluded, and no information is provided by facility, demographics, or cause. This dataset allows for deeper analysis of where, when, and how people are dying in custody."

Demographic breakdowns help show whether certain groups—by race, gender, or age—are disproportionately represented in deaths.\nA disparities analysis is in progress. For example, assessing whether certain racial groups experience higher death rates relative to their representation in the incarcerated population. This includes calculating relative rate indices using population baselines from facility-level and systemwide data where available.\n\nRaceGenderAge\n\n\nFrom 2020 to 2024, most people who died in custody were White (92% of deaths).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2020 to 2024, most people who died in custody were Male (94% of deaths).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2020 to 2024, most people who died in custody were 60-69 years old (22% of deaths).\n115 people who died in custody from 2020 to 2024 were under the age of 55 — that’s 42% of all deaths. 159 people (or 58%) were 55 or older.\nThe average age at time of death was 58.6 years old.

    "text": "Offender Status (Jail)\nMany people who die in jail custody are being held pretrial, meaning they have not been convicted of a crime. Despite this, they are housed in facilities operating far beyond their intended capacity. In some jails—like North Central Regional Jail—population levels have exceeded twice the design limit.\nAs Sara Whitaker has documented, people in these overcapacity facilities are often forced to sleep on mats on the floor, with limited access to basic hygiene and medical care. These conditions are not temporary. In some jails, overcapacity has been the norm for years, raising serious concerns about safety, dignity, and the state’s duty of care.\nFrom 2020 to 2024, most people who died in custody were classified as “PTF Pretrial Felon” (53% of deaths)."

The jails with the most deaths were Southern Regional Jail and North Central Regional Jail. As of December 2023, North Central Regional Jail was operating at 193% of its original design capacity, with 228 people assigned to sleep on the floor. Southern Regional Jail was at 141% of design capacity, with 156 people sleeping on the floor. These conditions pose serious safety risks. Overcrowding reduces access to medical care, increases the spread of illness, and makes it harder for staff to prevent suicide or respond to medical emergencies."

This will allow for comparisons that account for population size. For example, a facility with 5 deaths and an average daily population of 100 has a far higher death rate than one with 10 deaths and 1,000 people. These rates will help identify facilities where the risk of dying is especially high, regardless of total population.\nProjects like the UCLA Behind Bars Data Project use similar methods to track death rates across systems—often using reported custody populations as denominators."

    "text": "Purpose\nWhen someone dies in a jail or prison, their loved ones are often left without answers. The public, too, is left in the dark—unable to understand where and why these deaths happen, or what conditions may have contributed to them. In West Virginia, meaningful transparency around deaths in custody is rare. The state does not publish names, demographic details, causes of death, or the facilities where people died. Many deaths—particularly in jails—are not reflected in public reporting at all.\nThis project exists to help fill that gap.\nIt provides the first publicly accessible, facility-level dataset of deaths in West Virginia’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR) custody. It seeks to document when and where people have died, and to offer context around those deaths by linking them to facility characteristics and other public data."
